## Setting up

[justextract.it](https://justextract.it) is Nex AI's in-house data extraction suite that turns data from any source into JSON. Our solution surpasses traditional OCR by using a hybrid Vision Language Model (VLM) approach, ensuring the best accuracy through constant testing and fine-tuning.

To get started, you'll need to obtain a paid API key. [Book a call with Jon](https://app.apollo.io/#/meet/jonathan/15-min-onboarding) for a 15-minute onboarding session to ensure a smooth setup process.
