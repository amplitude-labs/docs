## Introduction

PDF-to-JSON extraction is a common and crucial element of business-wide data integration. Here are some tips to keep in mind when sending PDFs (e.g. POs, RFQs, Quotations, Forms, etc) to our API for extraction.

## Best Practices for Preparing PDFs

1. **Lighting**: If a scan or image is being sent as PDF, ensure that the lighting is even and sufficient.

2. **Angle**: If a scan or image is being sent as PDF, ensure that you positioned the camera directly above a flat surface to avoid distortion.

3. **Background**: Choose a clean, uncluttered background to keep the focus on the subject. A neutral color is often best.

4. **Resolution**: Save PDFs at the highest resolution possible to ensure clarity and detail.

5. **Focus**: Ensure the document is in sharp focus. Use manual focus if necessary to achieve the best results.

## Conclusion

By following these best practices, we can guarantee the quality and accuracy of our extraction suite will amaze and empower you to do more in your business, faster.
