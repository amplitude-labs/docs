## Introduction

Image-to-JSON extraction is a common and crucial element of business-wide data integration. Here are some tips to keep in mind when sending images (e.g. scans, screenshots, and straight up smartphone captures) to our API for extraction.

## Best Practices for Capturing Images

1. **Lighting**: Ensure that the lighting is even and sufficient.

2. **Angle**: Position the camera directly above the flat surface to avoid distortion.

3. **Background**: Choose a clean, uncluttered background to keep the focus on the subject. A neutral color is often best.

4. **Resolution**: Capture images at the highest resolution possible to ensure clarity and detail.

5. **Focus**: Ensure the subject is in sharp focus. Use manual focus if necessary to achieve the best results.

By following these best practices, we can guarantee the quality and accuracy of our extraction suite will amaze and empower you to do more in your business, faster.
