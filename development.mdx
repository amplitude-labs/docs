If you haven't already, please refer to our [Quickstart Guide](/quickstart) first to understand the basics of making API calls with justextract.it.

## Prerequisites

- A valid API key (obtained from the [quickstart process](/quickstart))
- Environment variable `JUSTEXTRACT_API_KEY` properly configured
- Basic understanding of making API requests

## Advanced Filtering

The justextract.it API supports sophisticated filtering capabilities through an array of filter objects. Each filter object can be one of the following types:

### Content Type Filtering

Filter content based on specific types:

```json
{
  "include": false,
  "content_types": ["table", "image", "text", "hyperlink"]
}
```

### Keyword Filtering

Search for specific keywords within the document:

```json
{
  "include": false,
  "keywords": ["specific", "terms", "to", "find"]
}
```

### Custom Query Filtering

Use natural language queries to find relevant content:

```json
{
  "include": false,
  "query": "Find sections discussing financial performance"
}
```

### Page Number Filtering

Extract specific pages:

```json
{
  "include": false,
  "pages": [1, 3, 5]
}
```

### Page Orientation Filtering

Filter based on page orientation:

```json
{
  "include": false,
  "orientation": "portrait" // or "landscape"
}
```

<Note>
  - The `include` parameter defaults to `false` if not specified - Filters can
  be combined in any order within the filters array - Multiple instances of the
  same filter type can be used - Filter processing is optimized: non-AI filters
  (page number, orientation) are processed first - Sequential filtering: Results
  from one filter are passed to the next filter in the array
</Note>

### Example Request with Multiple Filters

```json
{
  "url": "https://example.com/document.pdf",
  "filters": [
    {
      "pages": [1, 2, 3],
      "include": true
    },
    {
      "keywords": ["revenue", "growth"],
      "include": true
    },
    {
      "query": "Find sections discussing market analysis",
      "include": true
    }
  ]
}
```

<Warning>
  Using multiple filters, especially custom queries, may impact processing time
  and costs. Consider optimizing your filter strategy based on your specific
  needs.
</Warning>
