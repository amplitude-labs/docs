This quickstart guide will help you make your first API call to [justextract.it](https://justextract.it) in under 5 minutes. If you are looking for detailed API specifications, please refer to our [reference document](/api-reference) instead.

## Step 1: Get an API Key

Please [book a meeting](https://app.apollo.io/#/meet/jonathan/15-min-onboarding) and
get a paid API key from our [console](https://justextract.it/console) thereafter.

<Info>
  **Important**: You will not be able to proceed without completing this step.
</Info>

## Step 2: Set your environment variable

```bash local.env
JUSTEXTRACT_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Step 3: Prepare a PDF file for test extraction

To speed up experimention, we will use a publicly hosted PDF report by McKinsey to demonstrate various extraction capabilities. Alternatively, feel free to use your own PDF document hosted publicly.

<Info>
  **Important**: Google Drive links or any proprietary cloud drive URLs pointing
  to a PDF will not work. Only raw PDFs, e.g. those hosted on S3 will be
  accessible by our service for privacy reasons.
</Info>

## Step 4: Copy the code below to make a `fetch` request

<ApiExamples />

## Step 5: Run the code in your development environment

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
node api.js
```


```bash python
python api.py
```

</CodeGroup>

A response should soon appear in your console.

### Success Response Object

To make development as easy as possible for you, all response objects are standardized across our APIs.

After sending over a URL pointing to the document intended for extraction, you should receive an object with `task_id` in return:

```json example-response.json
{
  "task_id": "some-id"
}
```

For a full list of values contained in a response, please refer to our [API reference](/api-reference).

<Tip>
  To increase your extraction volume, you may [request a custom pricing
  plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) from us.

  <Accordion title="How Images Get Extracted" icon="image">
    Images extractions are usually provided in one of two forms. Either, images are captioned or described, or they text within the image is extracted and any contextual visuals are thrown away. We extract both these pieces of data to provide a complete context-aware object that can look something like:

    ```json image-extraction.json
    {
      "type": "image",
      "description": "string",
      "text_detected": "true",
      "text_extracted": {
        "caption_at_top_left": {
          "id": "1",
          "text": "string"
          },
        "caption_at_top_right": {
          "id": "2",
          "text": "string"
        },
        "disclaimer_note_in_footer": {
          "id": "3",
          "text": "string"
        }
      }
    }
    ```

    We recommend parsing this through an Large Language Model, or using our [juststructure.it API](/api/reference) to conform the extracted JSON to a given schema.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How PDFs Get Extracted" icon="file">
    PDF extractions are done page by page. We extract text, images, visuals, layouts, etc, and provide a complete context-aware object that can look something like:

    ```json pdf-extraction.json
    {
      "language_detected": ["english", "vietnamese"],
      "handwritten_detected": "true",
      "extracted_data": [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "page": "1",
          "data": {
            "header": "string",
            "body": {
              "table": [
                {
                  "row_id": "1",
                  "content": "string"
                },
                {
                  "row_id": "2",
                  "content": "string"
                }
              ],
              "caption": "string"
            },
            "footer": {
              "signature": {
                "type": "image",
                "description": "string"
              },
              "disclaimer": "string"
            }
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    <Note>
      Text-only extraction is more expensive with our methods than traditional OCR.
      We specialise in multi-modal documents containing images, graphs, and odd
      layouts. If you are extracting text from essays, long form reports, and
      similar text-heavy documents, please let us know during our onboarding
      session.
