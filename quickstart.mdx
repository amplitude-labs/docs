## Step 2: Set your environment variable

```bash local.env
JUSTEXTRACT_API_KEY = YOUR_API_KEY
```

## Step 3: Prepare a PDF file for test extraction

To speed up experimention, you can download this [sample PDF](https://nexai.app) that we have prepared specially to demonstrate various extraction capabilities. Alternatively, feel free to use your own PDF document.

## Step 4: Copy the code below to make a `fetch` request

<ApiExamples />

## Step 5: Run the code in your development environment

```bash npm
node api.js
```

A response should soon appear in your console.

### Success Response Object

To make development as easy as possible for you, all response objects are standardized across our APIs:

```json example-response.json
{
  "language_detected": ["english", "vietnamese"],
  "handwritten_detected": "true",
  "extracted_data": [
    {
      "id": "1",
      "page": "1",
      "data": {
        "header": "string",
        "body": {
          "table": [
            {
              "row_id": "1",
              "content": "string"
            },
            {
              "row_id": "2",
              "content": "string"
            }
          ],
          "caption": "string"
        },
        "footer": "string"
      }
    }

  <Accordion icon="image" title="How Images Get Extracted">
    Images extractions are usually provided in one of two forms. Either, images are captioned or described, or they text within the image is extracted and any contextual visuals are thrown away. We extract both these pieces of data to provide a complete context-aware object that can look something like:

    ```json image-extraction.json
    {
      "type": "image",
      "description": "string",
      "text_detected": "true",
      "text_extracted": {
         "caption_at_top_left": {
          "id": "1",
          "text": "string"
        },
        "caption_at_top_right": {
          "id": "2",
          "text": "string"
        },
        "disclaimer_note_in_footer": {
          "id": "3",
          "text": "string"
        }
      }
    }

````

We recommend parsing this through an Large Language Model, or using our [juststructure.it API](/api/reference) to conform the extracted JSON to a given schema.

    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally.
    1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: ``` npm i -g mintlify ```
    2. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `docs.json` is): ``` mintlify dev ```
    <Note>
      If youâ€™re currently using the legacy ```mint.json``` configuration file, please update the Mintlify CLI:

      ```npm i -g mintlify@latest```
      And run the new upgrade command in your docs repository:

      ```mintlify upgrade```
      You should now be using the new ```docs.json``` configuration file. Feel free to delete the ```mint.json``` file from your repository.
